# navtracker — Maritime Multi-Sensor Fusion Tracker: Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** Draft for review
**Authors:** Andreas + Claude

---

## 1. Overview

navtracker fuses outputs from multiple maritime sensors into a single, authoritative set of vessel **tracks**. It is *not* a raw detector (no radar plot extraction or image-level object detection). It consumes the higher-level outputs that sensors already produce — AIS position reports, ARPA radar tracks, EO/IR camera detections, own-ship navigation — and produces one fused, de-duplicated, continuously maintained track picture.

The defining problem is **multi-target tracking (MTT) with data association**: deciding which incoming piece of data belongs to which target among many, spawning new tracks, maintaining them, and deleting stale ones — while exploiting sensor-provided identifiers (MMSI, ARPA track ID) when present but never depending on them.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Fuse heterogeneous sensor outputs into one authoritative track set.
- Full multi-target data association; opportunistic use of sensor IDs as hints.
- Every track carries a **stable, unique internal track ID** independent of external identity.
- Single core engine runs both **real-time (onboard)** and **deterministic replay** of recorded logs.
- Per-track outputs: fused kinematic state + covariance, identity/classification/size, lifecycle + provenance, derived CPA/TCPA.
- Pluggable data-association and estimator strategies so algorithms can be evaluated and swapped.
- Rigorous documentation of math, assumptions, decision rationale, and improvement paths.

### Non-Goals (this project)
- Raw detection (radar signal processing, image object detection).
- COLREGS / collision-avoidance *decision-making* (we expose CPA/TCPA; deciding maneuvers is downstream).
- Sensor hardware drivers / transport (adapters consume already-decoded messages or log records).
- UI / visualization (we expose a track API; rendering is a separate consumer).

## 3. Key Decisions (with rationale)

| # | Decision | Chosen | Rejected alternatives | Why |
|---|----------|--------|-----------------------|-----|
| D1 | Fusion topology | **Centralized, measurement-level** | Track-to-track (decentralized); Hybrid | Single source of truth → trivially yields a stable unique track ID even for non-cooperative targets; statistically near-optimal use of information. Sensor IDs become hints/attributes, not the fusion key. |
| D2 | Time base | **Message-timestamp driven** | Wall-clock driven | Makes live and replay use the identical engine; enables deterministic, reproducible tests. |
| D3 | Common coordinate frame | **Local tangent plane (ENU) about a configurable datum** | Geodetic lat/lon directly; ECEF | Linear-ish kinematics over operational ranges; simple covariances; avoids lat/lon distortion in filters. Geodetic conversion happens only at the boundary. |
| D4 | Late/out-of-order data default | **Drop beyond reorder window + log** | Retrodiction/OOSM update | Simpler, deterministic baseline. Retrodiction listed as a documented improvement (§11). |
| D5 | Baseline data association | **Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN)** | JPDA, MHT | Predictable cost, good enough to validate the pipeline; pluggable so JPDA/MHT can be evaluated later. |
| D6 | Baseline estimator | **EKF** (IMM-ready) | UKF, Particle filter, linear KF | Handles nonlinear range/bearing measurement models; cheap; pluggable. IMM/particle to be evaluated for maneuvering targets. |
| D7 | Architecture style | **Clean architecture + hexagonal (ports & adapters)** | Layered monolith | Keeps sensor formats and I/O at the edges; domain core has zero I/O dependencies; strategies are ports → highly testable and swappable. |
| D8 | Sensor reference | **Separate document** | Inline in this spec | It's a living reference that will grow per sensor; keeping it standalone keeps this spec stable. |

> Scale/performance envelope is intentionally **undecided**. The design keeps association and estimator on the hot path swappable so the system can be tuned once real load is known.

- **Domain core**: tracks, estimators, association, track management, attribute fusion. Pure C++, no I/O, no sensor formats. Depends only on abstractions.
- **Ports (interfaces)**: `ISensorAdapter`, `ITrackSink`, `IDataAssociator`, `IEstimator`, `IMotionModel`, `IClock`/time-source.
- **Adapters**: concrete sensor parsers and output sinks; implement ports; live outside the core.
- **Dependency rule**: source dependencies point inward. Adapters depend on the core; the core never depends on adapters.

### Module layout (proposed)

```

## 5. Core Domain Types

- **`Measurement`** — normalized sensor output handed to the core:
  - `timestamp` (source time), `source_id`, `sensor_kind`
  - `frame` (ENU about datum), value subset (position, and/or range/bearing, and/or velocity)
  - measurement covariance `R`
  - optional association hints: `mmsi`, `sensor_track_id`
  - optional attributes: vessel type, dimensions, classification, confidences
- **`Track`** — authoritative fused entity:
  - `track_id` (stable internal primary key, never reused)
  - kinematic state `x`, covariance `P`, motion-model tag
  - lifecycle status (Tentative / Confirmed / Coasting / Deleted)
  - attribute set (identity, type, dimensions, classification) each with confidence + provenance
  - provenance: contributing sources, update history
  - derived: CPA, TCPA vs own-ship
- **Strategy ports**: `IDataAssociator`, `IEstimator`, `IMotionModel`.
- **Edge ports**: `ISensorAdapter` (produces `Measurement`s), `ITrackSink` (consumes track updates).

## 6. Data Flow & Determinism

1. Adapters decode native input → raw typed reports, stamped with source time.
2. Normalizer projects each report into the ENU frame using the latest own-ship nav; builds `Measurement` with covariance `R`.
3. Time-ordered buffer releases measurements in timestamp order within a bounded reorder window (configurable). Beyond the window → drop + log (D4).
4. For each released measurement: predict all tracks to its timestamp → associate (gating + assignment) → update matched tracks → unmatched measurements feed track initiation.
5. Track manager runs lifecycle transitions; attribute fusion merges identity/type/size; CPA/TCPA derived.
6. Track sink emits the updated track set.

**Determinism:** the engine advances only on measurement timestamps. Replay feeds logged messages with original stamps through the same buffer → identical results given identical input ordering. Live mode differs only in *where* messages come from and the real-time release of the buffer.

## 7. Track Lifecycle

`Tentative → Confirmed → Coasting → Deleted`
- **Initiation**: unmatched measurement seeds a Tentative track.
- **Confirmation**: M-of-N detections or score threshold (documented, configurable).
- **Coasting**: no association this cycle → predict-only; covariance grows.
- **Deletion**: timeout or score below floor. `track_id` retired, never reused.
- Every transition recorded in provenance.

## 8. Error Handling & Edge Cases

- **Missing/late own-ship nav** → cannot project relative measurements; extrapolate own-ship for a bounded time, flag affected tracks, else hold.
- **Identity conflicts** (two MMSIs on one track, or one MMSI on two tracks) → documented resolution policy; kinematic track remains primary.
- **Per-sensor clock skew** → configurable time offset per source applied at normalization.
- **Implausible/spoofed AIS** → plausibility gating before attribute fusion (kinematic consistency check).
- **Boundary validation**: adapters validate parse/units/NaN. Internal stages trust their inputs (validated-at-the-edge).

## 9. Testing Strategy (gtest)

- **Unit tests** per stage and per strategy, written against the port interfaces (mocks/fakes for ports).
- **Scenario / replay tests**: synthetic ground-truth scenarios — crossing, overtaking, head-on, AIS dropout, non-cooperative (no-MMSI) target, sensor clock skew — assert track continuity, **ID stability**, and accuracy vs. truth.
- **Metrics harness**: track-accuracy / OSPA-style metrics to *quantitatively compare* estimator and association choices later (directly serves the "what to test next" goal).
- Determinism test: same log replayed twice → identical track output.
- Build: CMake + Conan; gtest pulled via Conan; tests run in CI-friendly fashion.

## 10. Documentation Standard (project-wide rule)

Every non-trivial algorithmic component is documented with a fixed four-part template:

1. **Math** — state/measurement models, equations, covariances, coordinate conventions.
2. **Assumptions** — what must hold for the math to be valid.
3. **Rationale** — why this approach over the considered alternatives.
4. **Ways to improve / what to test next** — concrete candidate alternatives and the experiment to evaluate them.

This template is enforced via CLAUDE.md and applied to the algorithm sections below and all future ones.

## 11. Baseline Algorithm Documentation

### 11.1 State & motion model (baseline: Constant Velocity, ENU 2D)

**Math.** State `x = [px, py, vx, vy]ᵀ` in ENU meters / m·s⁻¹. Discrete CV model over step `Δt`:

```
x_k = F(Δt) x_{k-1} + w,   F = [[1,0,Δt,0],[0,1,0,Δt],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
Q = process noise from continuous white-noise acceleration with PSD q  (standard CV Q(Δt))
```

**Assumptions.** Targets move ~constant velocity between updates; maneuvers absorbed by process noise `q`; flat-Earth ENU valid over operational range; 2D (surface) motion.

**Rationale.** CV is the standard, robust baseline; minimal state; nonlinearity lives only in measurement models. Chosen over constant-acceleration (overfits) and coordinated-turn (premature) for a first cut.

**Ways to improve / test next.** IMM mixing CV + coordinated-turn for maneuvering vessels; tune/learn `q` per target class; 3D state if needed.

### 11.2 Measurement models

**Math.**
- AIS / position-type: linear `z = H x`, `H = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0]]` (and velocity rows when COG/SOG present). Gaussian `R` from reported/assumed accuracy.
- EO/IR bearing-only and radar range/bearing: nonlinear `z = h(x)` (range `√(px²+py²)`, bearing `atan2(py,px)` relative to own-ship after frame transform); linearized via Jacobian `H = ∂h/∂x` for the EKF.

**Assumptions.** Gaussian, zero-mean measurement noise; covariances `R` known/estimable per sensor (see sensor reference); own-ship pose known at measurement time.

**Rationale.** EKF linearization is adequate for the mild nonlinearity of range/bearing at operational geometry; far cheaper than UKF/particle.

**Ways to improve / test next.** UKF for stronger nonlinearity / bearing-only geometry; particle filter for highly non-Gaussian/multimodal cases (e.g. bearing-only before range converges); per-sensor `R` calibration from data.

### 11.3 Data association (baseline: GNN)

**Math.** Mahalanobis gating `d² = ν ᵀ S⁻¹ ν` (innovation `ν`, innovation covariance `S = HPHᵀ + R`) with χ² gate; assignment minimizes total gated cost (e.g. auction/Hungarian). Sensor ID hints (MMSI, ARPA track ID) bias/lock association when present and plausible.

**Assumptions.** ≤1 measurement per track per sensor per cycle; gating covariances trustworthy; clutter modest.

**Rationale.** Deterministic, bounded cost, easy to reason about; sufficient to validate fusion before investing in probabilistic association.

**Ways to improve / test next.** JPDA for dense/ambiguous clutter; MHT for deferred decisions; learned/feature-aided association using attributes (size, type).

## 12. Phasing & Deliverables

**Phase 0 (this phase — docs only, no engine code):**
- This design spec.
- `CLAUDE.md` — stack (C++17/Conan/CMake), conventions, hexagonal/clean-architecture invariants, the §10 documentation template, testing-with-gtest expectations.
- Sensor-data reference doc — per sensor: data fields, units, update rates, error/covariance characteristics, identity content, failure modes, gotchas.

**Phase 1+ (later, via implementation plan):** project skeleton (CMake/Conan, gtest) → core domain types → ports → adapters → baseline GNN+EKF tracker → scenario/replay test harness + metrics. Then algorithm evaluation (IMM/UKF/particle, JPDA/MHT) using the metrics harness.

## 13. Open Questions / To Revisit

- Datum strategy for the ENU origin: fixed datum vs. own-ship-referenced vs. periodic re-origin for long transits.
- Exact confirmation/deletion policy parameters (M-of-N vs. score-based) — decide during Phase 1 with scenario data.
- Whether ARPA tracks ever need true track-level fusion (covariance intersection) rather than pseudo-measurement treatment — revisit if measurement-level proves biased.
- Multi-radar overlap handling (same target from two radars in one cycle) — refine association's one-measurement-per-track assumption.

## 14. Future Improvements (deferred)

Items captured here so we do not lose them. None are scheduled; each is a
candidate project in its own right.

### 14.1 Sensor pose on measurements

Add `sensor_position_enu` (and eventually `sensor_orientation`) to
`Measurement` so the range/bearing/bearing-only h(x) families can be
evaluated against an arbitrary sensor pose instead of the implicit ENU
origin. Defaults to `(0,0)` so existing tests and adapters are unaffected.

**Unlocks.** True bearing-only fusion with parallax (own-ship motion makes
range observable); shore-based or off-origin sensors; multi-platform fusion
(own-ship + escort + UAV).

**Cost.** ~50 lines + tests in `MeasurementModels` and the adapter layer.
Independent of, but prerequisite to, 14.2.

### 14.2 Rigid-body platform / target geometry

Two coupled extensions:

1. **Own-ship sensor offsets.** Configurable `(dx, dy)` per sensor relative
   to the navigation reference point (GPS antenna). Adapters apply the
   offset when populating `sensor_position_enu`. Today every sensor is
   implicitly co-located at the GPS antenna; the error is bounded by the
   longest offset (~50 m on a 100 m platform). Sub-percent at open-water
   ranges; meaningful at harbor / docking ranges.

2. **Target geometry into association + CPA.** `TrackAttributes` already
   carries `length_m` and `beam_m`; today they are populated by adapters
   and never consumed. Wire them into:
   - **CPA / collision metrics** — replace `‖center_A − center_B‖` with a
     bow/beam-aware closest-approach calculation.
   - **Association strength** — radar return size consistency with claimed
     vessel length as an extra association feature alongside Mahalanobis
     gating.
   - **Outlier rejection** — a measurement that "jumps" by less than half
     the hull length is likely a different return from the same ship, not
     a tracking glitch.

**Unlocks.** Honest collision-avoidance metrics; stronger association at
close range; better lifecycle decisions when measurement spread is
comparable to vessel size.

**Cost.** Medium. Sensor-offset config + adapter changes ~100 lines.
Geometry-aware CPA + association feature is a separate, larger change.

### 14.3 Extended object tracking

Promote target extent (length, beam, orientation) into the dynamic state
rather than carrying it as a passive attribute. State grows to roughly
`[px, py, vx, vy, ψ, L, B]`; motion model needs leeway and heading-vs-
velocity-direction constraints; measurement models must handle radar
extent reports and camera bounding boxes natively.

**Unlocks.** Tracking maneuvering large vessels accurately at close range
(tugs, anchor handling, low-speed dock approaches); confidence on size
from multi-look fusion; native handling of extended-return sensors.

**Cost.** Substantial — its own project. Predicate: 14.1 and 14.2 in place
so that the simpler representations have been exhausted first.

### 14.4 Bearing-only scenarios with own-ship motion

Once 14.1 is in, build a scenario harness that emits bearing-only
measurements from a moving sensor frame. This is the smallest meaningful
scenario where a particle filter should provably outperform EKF / UKF
(banana-shaped posterior during the parallax convergence window). Until
14.1 lands, bearing-only from a stationary sensor at the ENU origin is
range-unobservable and all three filters tie at the prior-range uncertainty
(see `docs/algorithms/evaluation-log.md` entry of 2026-06-01).

### 14.5 Close-range precision sensors

Add support for sensors whose error budget is dramatically tighter than
nav-class radar at sub-kilometre ranges. The classes worth wiring:

1. **Laser rangefinder** — range σ ~1 m and bearing σ ~0.05° at 0–500 m
   when manually aimed or auto-tracked on a designated target. Existing
   `RangeBearing2D` model fits with no math change; only a new adapter is
   needed.
2. **Docking / close-range radar** (e.g. Furuno DRS-NXT short range) —
   sub-metre range and tighter bearing than nav radar at <100 m. Same
   measurement model, separate adapter so its `R` reflects the tighter
   spec.
3. **Stereo / RGB-D camera** — range + bearing at <50 m for visually
   detected vessels. Same `RangeBearing2D`; the adapter extracts depth
   from disparity or the camera's depth channel.
4. **Forward-looking sonar** — range to surface/sub-surface obstacles.
   Needs a new `Range2D` measurement model (range only, no bearing) and
   its own adapter.

**Unlocks.** Harbor pilotage / docking / anchor-handling / escort-tug
operations where target proximity is what matters and nav radar's 50 m
range σ swamps the posterior. The tighter `R` dominates the fusion at
close range, so the gain shows up automatically without changing the
estimator.

**Cost.** Per sensor class: ~80 lines for the adapter, plus `Range2D`
infrastructure if forward-looking sonar is in scope (~50 lines for the
measurement model and its tests). `SensorKind` already has `Lidar`;
add `LaserRangefinder`, `DockingRadar`, `StereoCamera`, and `Fls` when
the corresponding adapters are wired.

**Dependency.** Only meaningful after 14.1 (sensor pose on measurements).
A laser rangefinder mounted on the bow with the GPS antenna 30 m aft
would otherwise have its precise return co-located at the GPS receiver,
defeating the precision. 14.2 (own-ship sensor offsets) further refines
this for multi-sensor platforms. Without 14.1 the close-range sensors
will appear to "miss" the target by their own mount offset.
